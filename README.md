LEAFINSIGHT: A SMART DETECTION OF VEGETABLE DISEASES USING DEEP VISION
In the modern agricultural world, early detection of plant diseases is critical for 
growing healthy crop and reducing losses. Old and traditional methods to identify a 
plant disease are often time consuming and requires a expert knowledge, which makes 
them less accessible to regular farmers and people. This project focuses on the 
development of a mobile based disease detection system that uses an advanced deep 
vision techniques to accurately identify diseases in vegetable plants very specifically 
Potato, Tomato, and Bell Pepper (Capsicum) crops. This system focuses on key leaf 
diseases, including Late Blight and Early Blight of Potatoes, Tomato Mosaic Virus of 
Tomatoes, and Bacterial Spot of Bell Peppers. We studied various Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) architectures, like MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResNet50, 
EfficientNetB0, and InceptionV2 to select model that is suitable for our project and 
gain good knowledge about the overall model accuracy, efficiency, and behaviour. 
This deep analysis significantly contributed to our understanding of machine learning 
and deep vision techniques. Based on our findings, we used MobileNetV2 model 
which is suitable for mobile application. Our model achieved an accuracy of 95.5%. 
This allows plant disease detection from many different Environmental conditions. 
This model communicates with the custom mobile application we developed through 
fastAPI, which allows users to scan plant leaves for diseases using their smartphone 
cameras. The mobile app, along with the FastAPI based backend, is deployed on a 
cloud service to make sure smooth, reliable, and efficient system performance.
